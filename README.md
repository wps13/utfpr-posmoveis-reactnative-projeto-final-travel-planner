# Welcome to Travel Planner ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

This app aims to help an user while planning its trip, given some info like destiny, budget, travel duration and time, it will use google AI to generate a guide.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Folder Structure and Patterns

The project folder structure is designed for clarity, maintainability, and scalability. Below is an overview of the main directories and the patterns used:

```
travel-planner/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/                # Main application code, screens, and routes
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.tsx       # Home screen (entry point)
â”œâ”€â”€ components/         # Reusable UI components (e.g., buttons, inputs)
â”œâ”€â”€ services/           # External services and integrations (e.g., AI API)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ai/             # AI-related service logic
â”œâ”€â”€ styles/             # Global styles and theme files
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/             # Images, fonts, and other static resources
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md           # Project documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json        # Project dependencies and scripts
â””â”€â”€ ...                 # Other configuration files
```

### Adopted Patterns

- **Componentization:** UI components are placed in `components/` and reused across different screens.
- **Service separation:** Logic for external API integrations is kept in `services/`, making testing and maintenance easier.
- **Centralized styles:** Global styles and themes are stored in `styles/` for visual consistency.
- **File-based routing:** Screens and routes are organized by file inside the `app/` folder, following the Expo Router convention.

This structure makes collaboration easier and helps keep the project scalable and organized.
